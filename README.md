# Monovera

**Monovera** (One Truth) is an open-source Windows Forms application that allows users to efficiently **visualize**, **search**, and **navigate** a Jira requirement repository structured using **parent-child relationships**.

It is ideal for product development, QA, and business analysis teams working with structured Jira data. Monovera provides a user-friendly interface to explore hierarchical issue relationships and access detailed issue information — including attachments, links, history, and even embedded `.feature` files from SVN.

## 🛠 Configuration

Before launching the app, create a `configuration.json` file in the application directory with the following structure:

```json
{
  "Jira": {
    "Url": "https://YOUR_DOMAIN.atlassian.net",
    "Email": "YOUR_EMAIL@YOUR_DOMAIN.com",
    "Token": "YOUR_TOKEN"
  },
  "Projects": [
    {
      "Project": "PROJECT1",
      "Root": "PRJ1-100",
      "Types": {
        "Issue Type1": "type_icon1.png",
        "Issue Type2": "type_icon2.png"
      },
      "Status": {
        "Status 1": "status_1.png",
        "Status 2": "status_2.png"
      }
    },
    {
      "Project": "PROJECT2",
      "Root": "PRJ2-1",
      "Types": {
        "Issue Type3": "type_icon3.png",
        "Issue Type4": "type_icon4.png"
      },
      "Status": {
        "Status X": "status_X.png",
        "Status Y": "status_Y.png"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- `Jira.Url`: Your Jira instance base URL  
- `Projects`: List of projects to load with root issue key, type and status icons  
- `Types` & `Status`: Maps for custom icons used for each type/status

🔒 **Note**: Your credentials are used locally only — no telemetry or remote logging.

## 🔎 Search Example

Click on the tree area and press `Ctrl+Shift+Q` to open the search dialog.

You can:
- Enter an issue key to jump directly
- Or search by text across selected projects
- Filter by Issue Type and Status

Results appear in a collapsible viewer with clickable links like:

```text
🧑 Add login validation [PRJ1-123]
🧑 Setup error messages [PRJ2-124]
```

Clicking a result auto-navigates the tree to that issue.
